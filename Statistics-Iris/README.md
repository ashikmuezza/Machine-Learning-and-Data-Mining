# Iris tasks
1. Pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients. The function takes two variables as arguments and returns the correlation coefficient between them. 

2. Plotting the graphs to visualize the correlation between two variables and also write a code to visualize the correlation matrix. 

3. Z-score standardization on the data. 

4. Covariance matrix for the standardized data.

5. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the covariance matrix and return in descending order.
