# Hidden markov model
Hidden Markov models are probabilistic frameworks where the observed data are modeled as a series of outputs generated by one of several (hidden) internal states. The main goal of HMM is to learn about a Markov chain by observing its hidden states. Considering a Markov process X with hidden states Y here the HMM solidifies that for each time stamp the probability distribution of Y must not depend on the history of X according to that time.
