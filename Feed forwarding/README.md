# Feed forwarding algorithm
A Feed Forward Neural Network is an artificial neural network in which the connections between nodes does not form a cycle. The opposite of a feed forward neural network is a recurrent neural network, in which certain pathways are cycled. The feed forward model is the simplest form of neural network as information is only processed in one direction. While the data may pass through multiple hidden nodes, it always moves in one direction and never backwards.
