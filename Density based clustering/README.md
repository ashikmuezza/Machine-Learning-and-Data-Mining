# Dbscan 
Clustering on country dataset using DBSCAN algorithm. Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is a base algorithm for density-based clustering. It can discover clusters of different shapes and sizes from a large amount of data, which is containing noise and outliers. 

The DBSCAN algorithm uses two parameters:
    1) minPts: The minimum number of points (a threshold) clustered together for a region to be considered dense.
    2) eps (Îµ): A distance measure that will be used to locate the points in the neighborhood of any point.
