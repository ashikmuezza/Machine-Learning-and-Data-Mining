# Decision Trees
The Decision trees are built by using nodes and branches and it follows a flow like data structure where in each internal node represent a Test on a dataset and each branch represent a Result of the test.. 

1.  By applying the classification rules we can split the nodes in the decision tree and the path which has produced from the root to the leaf nodes represent the classification rules.

2. In our example of our decision tree it has produced internal nodes and the branches where we can predict the output of the testing dataset by using that tree structured results.
